many anthropologists taught and accepted the belief
scientific racism was combined
it had lost widespread popularity effect
they were pressured to revise sources of phenotypic variation
he came to view racial designation as invalid
debates about have the population
it have biologists
most definitions rely qualitative descriptions on
definitions for populations , he identify two broad types of
they are of paradigm
the subspecies are traditionally geographically isolated
it is microevolutionary divergence
it is degree of differentiation
it would have biologically different to somewhat be to be considered a subspecies
templeton argued is level of difference
organisms must have a measurable level of to be seen on difference
dean amadon proposed subspecies be defined

of the factors is the maintenance
they function can switch to different supply voltages
the main disadvantage is by significant capital expenditure
two types are obtained with freight and passenger traffic
electric locomotives is used to haul passengers cars
electricity is being generated by generating stations
the railway entity provides distribution lines , switches and transformers
the principal alternative is diesel engine
electric locomotives locomotives are usually more reliable
it provide regenerative braking
diesel locomotives use petroleum
it is geothermal
can complicate electric railway service different supply voltages and frequencies ,
a safety hazard to track workers is voltages on contact wires
it is overhead wires
considered unsightly. overhead wires are not being widely used
it is variable speeds
conversion was not well developed dc motor is being used
two types of railway transportation still are use dc motor of rapid transit ( subways ) and trams
low voltage ratings , motors have little space
it is below 1 kv
safety reasons voltage almost always is used
overhead wires uses higher voltages
dc type garantees lesser loss
ac creates electromagnetic radiation
it can interfere with signalling and communications
requires three-phase transmission to ac
it was built by the soviet union
1,500 v is most common voltage
two narrow-gauge lines
dc is being used in the cascais line
3 kv dc is being used
before a western railroad was new jersey transit called
it uses dc or ac of ac
mostly is used third rail or overhead wires by overhead wires
it penetrates to skin depth
it is third rail
third rail is more prefferable
low voltages dc system can effect the speed of trains
it is 160 km / h
it is streetcars
it is below street level
in washington , d.c. streetcars
the main reasons are cost and operating efficiency
in 2003 began to operate in france
it was discontinued in 1958
the circuit is divided in an energized segment
it uses four-rail system
the purpose is carries the electrical return
it is on + 420v dc
it is − 210v dc
milan was the system similar to london underground used as well
running rail carries any current is she
electrolytic damage danger , can return currents cause
water and gas mains , returned current effect water and gas
it are by using resistors
ceramic chairs insures minimal current leak during power rails instalation
it is shared two types of trains uk railroad system with 660 v
a to simplify rolling stock use some sections of bakerloo and district lines were rewired to three-rail system
a rubber tyres some lines of paris metro have to operate on a four-rail system
a single polarity supply is required in order
a reversing loops train is able to turn around after each completed journey
it was in power-wasting resistors
different range can be supplied in multiple taps on the transformer
can provide lighting supply with low-voltage transformer windings
he will be replaced with three-phase induction motor
dc motor can turn if fitted with laminated pole pieces
ac distribution caused inductive reactance and eddy current losses problems
railways try low ac frequencies to solve the problem of inductive reactance
it can be obtained converted from utility power
non-standard gauge trains started to operate adopting the already proven rhb system .
it was tested 1913
25 hz was typically used
it uses 12 kv voltage
catenary voltage is similar
it was being used on 1 december 1909
victoria to crystal palace line used the overhead wire system first victoria to crystal palace or peckham rye
it was the first world war
at 6.7 kv 25 hz was used
it was compare of italy
it lasted 1901 until 1976
it operated in 1909 to 1927
hungary has first tried to use single-phase ac
16 kv at 50 hz , it used
four-pole rotating phase converter was used
russian was adopted in hungary
phase breaks invention prevented lines from getting mixed
it was in the earthed section
they were warned to start coasting the train as warning board
the driver should do to shut off power and coast
it is converting and transporting
ohmic losses happen
magnetic field losses take place
higher losses had 3 kv dc
3 kv dc was used in soviet union
stationary hardware came
can be seen " sparks effect "
electrification can effect patronage / revenue
it can be rolling stock overhaul / replacement achieved
a major factor is whn network effects
through traffic to non-electrified lines was the reason
it can occur to long distance trips
electrification to isolated areas , can be a drawback of electrification of long distance freight trains
it makes diesel trains
it is a connections between different electrical services
can be more efficiently electricified by central station
electric train can be more energy efficient by regenerative braking
diesel continues to use energy
cooling blowers causes electric trains to waste energy
a liquid fuel is more scarce
it is to substitute other fuels
can be used in the future soviet studies from the 1980s
an electric became
1965 , could be marked as year
electric train used 25 % less fuel per ton-km less than diesel in the middle of 1970
better operating conditions on electrified lines , could be a factor of lower energy consumption
energy-intensity dropping caused the energy efficiency to go up
electric got improved during 1950-1973
2.65 % was saved and re-used
there are six million spanish language students .

botany is science of plant life
the word botany means " to feed " or " to graze "
a plant scientist is called in a botanist
herbalism led
it cultivated the plants of medical importance
universities started growing gardens 1540s onwards
universities had these gardens facilitated the academic study of plants
plant taxonomy was developed to the catalogue and describe their collections
molecular genetics and epigenetics is are the main themes
botany can be applied to providing staple foods
it can be applied for synthesis of chemicals and raw materials
it is de materia medica
it was written about herbal medicine
it was physician and pharmacologist
it is five-volume long
it was padua
it had gardens for medical use
it was considered to be a part of medicine
he was in the university of oxford
physician valerius cordus wrote historia plantarum
john gerard wrote about medicinal plants
ulisse aldrovandi is considered the father
robert hooke coined the term cells
cells were first discovered in cork
it is choices between pairs
it is diagnostic keys
new plants arriving in europe were in newly discovered countries
species plantarum is still used
the plants are classified to number of their male sexual organs
increasing knowledge of plant anatomy led scientists to believe that plants should be classified according
on a morphological complexity , candolle based his classification system
darwin introduced concept of common descent
it was grundzüge der wissenschaftlichen botanik
it was microscopist
a cell theory did schleiden
warming believed form communities
arthur tansley created the concept
nicholas vavilov built alphonse de candolle earlier upon
vavilov wrote about history of economic plants history
temperature influences water evaporation
rate of photosynthesis influences the rate of gas produced
auxin plant hormones enables the regulation
can auxin plant hormones also be used as herbicides
all plant cells are totipotent opened the door to plant genetic engineering
gottlieb haberlandt introduced the idea
a phylogenetic does systematics aim to discover
phylogenetics uses dna sequences to determine plant categories
for molecular analysis of dna , the angiosperm phylogeny group used determine a phylogeny
plants are important oxygen and food
it is photosynthesis
organic molecules is used to rebuild cells
oxygen is a byproduct
they prevent soil erosion
it is gymnosperms
it is called phycology
it is paleobotanists
scientists can learn evolutionary history of plants
it was cyanobacteria
they call the start in first trophic level
it can be increased plant breeding
they would study weeds problem in agriculture
chlorophyll is blue-green
chloroplasts organelles are unique to algae
a plant appears to be green
it is store and transport energy
it is formed as a first product of photosynthesis
starch is stored
fructose is used
lignin polymer is used to strengthen cell walls

a carbon dioxide is in lower concentration
sporopollenin polymer is found
it is lignin
it is phytochemistry
they come from from plants
it originally came from bark of willow trees
morphine comes from the opium poppy
charcoal is made pyrolysis of wood
plant habitats are environments where they complete their life
the goal is to understand
it is plant ecology
plants do interactions with other species
plants depend on edaphic ( soil ) and climatic factors
plants interact for resources with other species
it is called vegetation

they are produced genetically identical to the parent
it is apomixis
errors in cytokinesis , can cause the doubling
on form a new species happens to these new plants
it is commercial banana
it was thale cress , arabidopsis thaliana
it was sequenced in 2000
this plant was chosen as one of the smallest genomes
in understanding the genetics is sequencing done
new knowledge about plant function results
it is chosen small genomes
can be photosynthesis studied
red alga has been used to study plant cells
corn has been used
can attach to plant cells , it can affect a plant
it can use bacteria introducing the nif gene
genes are transferred to a plant in the root nodules
it is creation of genetically modified crops
schell and van montagu developed the procedures used
changes in gene function does epigenetics study
dna changes affect express themselves " ) differently plants
it is differences
an epigenetic changes process causes changes in plant cells
it is the zygote
continues to divide are the different cells formed
phloem sieve tubes stop forming lack nuclei
plants are information from the environment
the ancestor is charophyta algae
different from other land plants , because lack the vascular tissues makes mosses
for one or two sheathing layers protects the young plant
splits to release it , the plant escapes the seed
it is gymnosperms
evolution of the seed habit led
plants get their energy as sunlight
it is internal chemical and physical activities
water is transported from roots
mineral are acquired in as soluble ions
sucrose is produced in the leaves
hormones are moved by a variety of processes
it was introduced late 19th century
darwin felt the movements of plant shoots
auxins do promotes cell growth
plant callus can be coaxed into doing form roots and shoots
cytokinins are in control of cell division
cytokinins are produced in roots
it is determined cytokinesis
it is determined gibberelins
it is a plant anatomy
it is plant morphology
plants store in the nuclei their dna
stems bearing green photosynthesising leaves makes up the bodies of vascular plants
do not produce ground-penetrating vascular roots makes a plant non-vascular
most of the plant is involved in photosynthesis
sporophytes are generated nonphotosynthetic
they get food
water and minerals , the shoots get from the roots
it are used for to store food
in a can often regrow it happens
store water are the stems used for
woody plants are gymnosperms
a foliage leaves are large and flat
shared physical characteristics did linnaeus group organisms
darwin changed by ancestry rather than superficial characteristics
dna sequences are grouping determined currently
international botanical congress. maintains a standard
the main grouping is know as a kingdom
it is species
the genus is always capitalized
it is italicised
it represents a relationships and heredity
the relationships are determined shared inheritance
spines produced from areoles , would be an indication
convergent evolution might two plants be similar but not actually be in the same group
arisen independently can two different plants acquire the same traits
a derived characters show a shared ancestry
common ancestries are represented with tree-like diagrams
dna sequences is used now
morphological characters was previously used
dna grouping is genetic code itself is used
it was first used 1990s
it was based flowering plants
evolution in plants , can be learned from dna sequencing
technology has improved the study greatly increased the level of detail
scientists have learned about angiosperms in a which families represent the earliest branches

often were found singles
distortion happens
it is fidelity steadily declines as playback progresses
can be found at 510 mm
you can find only 200-210mm about ending of the groove
a feature is in a subsonic filter
a sounds commonly heard is the tonearm skating
you are most likely to hear tonearm skating by frequencies below about 20 hz frequencies
a limitation is limiting the playing time
amplitude of low frequencies is reduced is done during recordings to help reduce unwanted sounds
problems can be reduced is a benefit
amplitude at high frequencies is increased is done to high frequency sounds to lessen sound issues
a g . h. miller found
reproduction was more realistic is found
a recording amplitude decreased happens
recording amplitude increased happens
helpful , p . g . a . h. voigt found wente-style condenser microphones
wente-style condenser microphones helpful were pre-emphasis in the recording
a pre-emphasis most useful was above 1,000 hz
this finding was most significant in the 1925 era era

from long-held recording practices were he based off
new orthophonic curve became the predecessor
rca victor developed the new orthophonic curve
r.c. moyer wrote the publication
it was made with horns by many fine examples
it were acoustic limitations
it show take help mute these resonances
the cause was in took a lot of sound energy
western electric licensed recording method offered realistic sounds
carbon microphones used , were losing popularity
it condensered the brilliant midrange microphone offer
microphones and amplifiers was a benefit
victor orthophonic phonograph is one example of an acoustic phonograph on
folded horn with an exponential taper allowed better sounds
the sound was sounded like
magnetic pickups was used to dampen resonances in recordings
you would have first found the moving coil microphone around 1930
crystal pickups was a more economical option
it was high quality cuts

live and recorded versions were in a harder to tell the difference
it was introduced in early 1930s
bell telephone laboratories and western electric worked together to develop the western electric system
western electric system was used
33 1 ⁄ 3 rpm was used
it was believed to do improve the overall quality
a benefit was longer playback time
an inner groove distortion , could be avoided
sound was improved using the moving coil microphone to override noise in playback
avoiding the microscopic irregularities was wax used to improve recordings
master cuts were used to make vinyl pressings
the business was 1949
at 45 rpm worked best
lp record was used for longer recordings
radio listeners heard recordings broadcast aided in records sales
20 hz is generally the lowest sound
it is 20,000 hz
would engrave the master disc with record cutter
soft wax was used
harder lacquer was used

professional archivists , would offer the highest quality transfers
manipulated to remove analog flaws is one benefit
vinyl record sales declined between 1988 and 1991
in 1988 , it took hold
in final quarter of the 19th century , were groove recordings developed
old records and out-of-print recordings hold the most popularity

it is called the stube
chalets often face south or downhill
chalets are built of solid wood
it is placed for the stube
furniture is traditionally carved elaborately
they are traditionally constructed from alpine rocks
they are found in the higher parts of the valleys
19 have been identified
romansh language is spoken
the alps is one
austria is saalbach located
an over 120 million many people visit the alps every year
it is tourism
it began in the early 19th century
it were built during the belle époque
it were built in early in the 20th century
it was held 1882
it was held at st. moritz
it were chamonix , france
it were st. moritz , switzerland
they were garmisch-partenkirchen , germany
it was ran for the first time in 1930
it were ( 1992 )

they are located in switzerland
reasons of sustainability he are considering becoming car free zones
it are closed winter
can be treacherous in mountain passes
they under are polygenes ( many different genes )
eye colour or number of limbs is it
mutations lead to different variants , known as alleles
alleles cause different phenotype traits
regulatory regions of a gene can be far removed from its coding regions
it can be split into several exons
they store their genome rna
they are functional non-coding rnas
gregor mendel ( 1822 – 1884 ) first suggested the existence of discrete inheritable units
it is in independent assortment
one of blending inheritance was the dominant theory
charles darwin developed the theory of inheritance known
it was first published 1866
the word ' gene ' is derived from γένος ( génos )
it means " race , offspring "
wilhelm johannsen coined the word ' gene '
william bateson first used the word ' genetics '
deoxyribonucleic acid ( dna ) was shown to be the molecular repository of genetic information by experiments in the 1940s
rosalind franklin studied the structure of dna
james d. watson and francis crick published a model
it is in reverse transcription in retroviruses
it was determined in 1972
frederick sanger developed chain termination dna
the human genome project project used an automated version
the theories are called the modern evolutionary synthesis
george c. williams proposed an evolutionary concept of the gene
richard dawkins popularized ideas
the vast majority encode their genes in the long strands of dna ( deoxyribonucleic acid )
with a five-carbon sugar ( 2 ' -deoxyribose ) composes part
they are used adenine , cytosine , guanine , and thymine
of a phosphate group , dna consists
the backbone is made of phosphate-sugar
adenine base pairs
guanine pairs with cytosine
an exposed phosphate group is known
it begins by transcribing the gene into rna
rna has the base uracil in place
codons are a series of three-nucleotide sequences
the genetic code specifies the correspondence
it is its genome
it consists of a single , very long dna helix
thousands of genes is encoded
its locus is the region of the chromosome at
each locus contains one allele of a gene
they are bacteria and archaea
they store their genomes on a single large , circular chromosome
a horizontal gene transfer allows genes
it has prokaryotes
about barely 2 % is made of protein
about 80 % are expressed
it coding sequence ? is from often only a small part
the actual protein coding sequence plays only a small part
it is from dna regions that are not transcribed
untranslated regions of the rna is another element
all genes contain a regulatory sequence
it is recognized by transcription factors and rna polymerase
it does bind the transcription machinery well
in the dna to loop happens
enhancers increase by binding an activator protein transcription
silencers bind repressor proteins causes dna to be less available
untranslated regions is at both ends
it are untranslated regions
they contain untranslated introns
it are operons
multiple protein are a unit
the products typically have related functions
the products are in the same regulatory network
they typically have multiple protein-coding sequences
it is enhancers
can be about a gene 's introns
they operate in trans
it can be found different chromosomes
genes encode by alternative splicing and coding sequences multiple proteins
its mrnas must be concatenated by trans-splicing. arranged
a broad operational definition sort , can be used to conveniently encompass the complexity
it categorizes genes by their specific dna loci
it categorizes genes by their functional products ( proteins or rna )
the broad operational definition classifies regulatory elements
two steps are required are required to read the information encoded in a gene ' s dna and produce the specified protein
it is mrna is translated to protein
through the first step , must rna-coding genes still go
it is gene expression
sets are known as codons
they corresponds to a specific amino acid
the gene 's dna is used
the enzyme is called an rna polymerase
it occurs in the cytoplasm
it occurs transcription occurs in the nucleus
it stores the cell ' s dna in the nucleus
it is produced the primary transcript
the process by is of translation
it consists of large complexes of rna and protein
each trna has three
genes are expressed only when the product is needed
examples are available nutrients , temperature and other stresses
cell division cycle , metabolism , infection status are examples
gene expression can be regulated at at any step step
a typical protein-coding gene is first copied into rna
ribozymes are enzymatic function
the dna sequences from are non-coding rna genes
some viruses store their entire genome in in the form of rna
it is hiv
it requires reverse transcription sort
organisms inherit their genes from the from their parents
a complete copy is inherited from its parents
a sexual organism has two copies of each chromosome
a sexual organism inherits by one complete set
variations in its genotype is part
observable physical and behavioral characteristics are described
it is particular set of genes
each gene specifies a particular trait
two alleles do most eukaryotic organisms have
alleles can be located in order to can be at a locus
dominant alleles give rise to their corresponding phenotypes
alleles assort in the production of gametes independently
germ cells are gametes
the growth , development , and reproduction relies on cell division
it is dna polymerases enzyme
semiconservative characterizes the process
another thing is divide into two distinct membrane-bound cells
it occurs extremely fast
they are called eggs or ova
it is called mutations
the lowest error rate is 10 − 8 per nucleotide per replication
the highest error rate is 10 − 3
small mutations can be caused by dna replication
it can be caused by errors in recombination
it is called polymorphic
it can give rise to different phenotypic traits
it is known as the wild type
rare alleles are called mutants
genetic drift is one cause
mutations are called by silent mutations
mutations are called as synonymous mutations
mutations are called in conservative mutations
it is genetic disorders
the directional selection leads to adaptive evolution
they are called homologs
one reason is gene duplication within an organism 's genome
orthologous genes are genes called
comparings the sequence alignment for the relationship between genes
it is called for conserved sequence
genes typically accumulate mutations by neutral molecular evolution
he can be used for phylogenetic
it is gene duplication
the gene duplication creates copy number variation
they are called paralogs
it can sometimes result in nonfunctional
it are called pseudogenes
it is called de novo or " orphan " genes
it is 18 to 60
it compare typically shorter
it compares simpler in structure
horizontal gene transfer is the transfer of genetic material
it is antibiotic resistance
one characteristic is to genome size
they occur in viruses
it is in 2
viroids acts
it is 5 million
it was 2,000,000
they indicated the alternative variants
1 – 2 % consists
it are essential genes
it assumes an absence of environmental stress
half are orthologs
saccharomyces cerevisiae has 1000 genes
necessary are housekeeping genes type
they are expressed at at constant relative level
housekeeping genes are used as a control for experiments
it are regulated developmentally
hugo gene nomenclature committee ( hgnc ) has established gene nomenclature
it can be accessed through a database maintained by hgnc
it has only one
for a common model , the mouse plays a role
genetic engineering is known as the modification of an organism ' s genome
techniques began on the 1970s to be developed to add , remove and edit genes
they use engineered nuclease enzymes
targeted sort is created
the synthetic biology refers
genetic engineering has become a common research tool
scientists explore that gene 's function
an application for is agriculture
industrial biotechnology is another for
medicine is yet another application for
a gene therapy techniques , can be used to alter the genomes of an adult organism to treat genetic disease
the embryo part is usually created
to the genomes of cells , can be changed in an adult organism using gene therapy techniques
can be treated using genetic engineering genetic diseases
